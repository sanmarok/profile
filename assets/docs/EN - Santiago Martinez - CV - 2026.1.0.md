### **Professional Profile**

I view technology as a medium for solving complex problems. My professional journey began in engineering, a stage that granted me a non-negotiable structural vision: the conviction that no system can scale or endure without a solid and well-calculated foundation. This mindset follows me today in every line of code and throughout every design and implementation process.

I found in **code** more than just a work tool; I found an ally for solving complex issues, automating processes, and designing monitoring systems. My professional present beats at the pace of an **ISP**, where I manage the critical infrastructure that keeps people connected. I thrive on the adrenaline of resolving critical incidents and the technical satisfaction of maintaining stable networks and operational services.

I do not seek mere stability, but challenges that force me out of my comfort zone and allow me to learn from failures, understanding that every error is a lesson for tomorrow.
